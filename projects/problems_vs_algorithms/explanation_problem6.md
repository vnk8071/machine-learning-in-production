# Get Min Max

The get_min_max function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input list. This is because the function traverses the list once, checking each value to see if it's the new minimum or maximum.

The space complexity of the get_min_max function is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. This is because the space used does not change with the size of the input list, it only uses two integer variables to store the minimum and maximum values.
