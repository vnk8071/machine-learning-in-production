# Rotated Array Search

The rotated_array_search function uses a binary search algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the input list. This is because with each iteration, the binary search algorithm halves the search space.

The space complexity of the rotated_array_search function is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. This is because the space used does not change with the size of the input list, it only uses a few integer variables to store the intermediate results.

The linear_search function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input list. This is because in the worst-case scenario, it needs to iterate over each element in the list.

The space complexity of the linear_search function is also O(1), as it only uses a couple of variables and does not depend on the size of the input list.
