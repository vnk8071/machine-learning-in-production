# Sort 0, 1, 2

The sort_012 function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input list. This is because the function traverses the list once, performing a constant amount of work for each element.

The space complexity of the sort_012 function is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. This is because the space used does not change with the size of the input list, it only uses a few integer variables to store the intermediate results.
