# Square Root of an Integer

The sqrt function uses a binary search algorithm to find the square root of a number, which has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the input number. This is because with each iteration, the binary search algorithm halves the search space.

The space complexity of the sqrt function is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. This is because the space used does not change with the size of the input number, it only uses a few integer variables to store the intermediate results.
