## Large Python Codebases with Libraries
Learn how you can write, structure, and extend your code to be able to support developing large systems at scale. Understand how you can leverage open source libraries to quickly add advanced functionality to your code and how you can package your code into libraries of your own. Apply Object Oriented Programming to ensure that your code remains modular, clear, and understandable. Honing these skills are the foundations for building codebases that are maintainable and efficient as they grow to tens of thousands of lines.
