## SQL and Data Modeling for the Web
You'll learn the skills needed to traverse the stack and develop an entire database-backed web application. By the end of the course, you'll have the fundamentals you need to start building web applications, including how to do Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a database, how to apply these operations across both databases and web applications, how to set up relationships between elements of an application, and ultimately how to think about important principles and patterns in building data models for a web application

## API Development and Documentation
In this project, you will use the skills you’ve developed to build a Trivia API. The goal of this project is to use APIs to control and manage a web application using existing data models. You’ll be given a set of data models and the application front end. Your task will be to implement the API in Flask to make the Trivia game functional.

## Identity Access Management
In this part, you will build the backend for a coffee shop application. You’ll add user accounts and authentication to your application and use role-based access management strategies to control different types of user behavior in the app.

## Server Deployment and Containerization
Develop an understanding of containerized environments, use Docker to share and store containers, and deploy a Docker
container to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service using the CI/CD pipeline.

## Full Stack Capstone
You will now combine all of the new skills you’ve learned and developed in this course to construct a database-backed web API with user access control. You will choose what app to build and then you’ll design and build out all of the API endpoints needed for the application and properly secure them for use in any front end application (web or mobile).
